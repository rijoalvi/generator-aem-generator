generator-aem-generator (Work in progress) [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> A generator for creating full projects from scratch, components, clientlibs, dialogs and models.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

Then navigate to the project root folder, set it up and link it so it can be discovered by yeoman

```bash
npm install
npm link
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo aem-generator
```

to run a subgenerator, just add quotes after the generator command and write the subgenerator you want to run

```bash
yo aem-generator:clientlib
```
